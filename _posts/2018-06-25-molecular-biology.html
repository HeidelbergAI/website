<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>The field of Artificial Intelligence has made significant progress over the past years by 
making use of Deep Neural Networks. The ability of Deep Neural Networks to carry out complex mappings
in high dimensional spaces makes them extremely interesting for biological applications, e.g. for mapping genotypes to (molecular) phenotypes.</p>

<p>This talk gives an introduction to recent Deep Learning concepts that are interesting for Life Sciences, with
special focus on the ‘Attention Mechanism’ — a key concept of Neural Machine Translation.
State of the art results are presented by using Deep Neural networks for predicting DNA binding motifs, RNA secondary structure for given RNA sequence, and RNA sequence for given RNA secondary structure.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Event</h2><br>

<p>The talk takes place on <b>Monday, 25 June, 2018 at 6:30 pm at the DKFZ Communication Center, rooms K1/K2.</b></p>
<p>Wraps, beverages and beer are free -courtesy of the Division of Medical Image Computing @ DKFZ.</p>
