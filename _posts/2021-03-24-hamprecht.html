<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Perennial computer vision problems such as image partitioning, instance
segmentation or tracking can be reduced to combinatorial graph
partitioning problems.

The majority of models developed in this context have relied on purely
attractive interactions between graph nodes. To obtain more than a
single cluster, it is then necessary to pre-specify a desired number of
clusters, or set thresholds.

A notable exception to the above is multicut partitioning / correlation
clustering, which accommodates repulsive in addition to attractive
interactions, and which automatically determines an optimal number of
clusters. Unfortunately, the multicut problem is NP-hard.

In this talk, I will characterize the combinatorial problem and discuss
its representations in terms of node or edge labelings. I will discuss
greedy algorithms that find approximate solutions and do well in real
applications, in particular the mutex watershed and greedy agglomerative
signed graph partitioning.

Joint work with Steffen Wolf, Constantin Pape, Nasim Rahaman, Alberto
Bailoni, Ullrich Koethe, Anna Kreshuk.</p>

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p>Fred Hamprecht develops machine learning algorithms for image analysis. He applies these methods to challenging problems
mainly from bioimage analysis, and is particularly interested in making "structured" predictions. His favorite methods
have a sound mathematical background, such as combinatorial optimization or algebraic graph theory,
while being widely applicable and useful in practice.

Fred is a Professor at Heidelberg University and still thinks of science as the greatest profession on earth.
