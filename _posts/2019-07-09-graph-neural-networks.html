<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and occurs in several application domains. Graph representation learning approaches, however, have been limited to such applications where a graph structure is given or have used heuristics to construct affinity graphs before learning commences. One of the long-standing goals of machine learning is to infer and leverage relational dependencies, even if not available a-priori.  We propose an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly learns the graph and weights of a graph convolutional network by approximately solving a bilevel program whose inner and outer objectives aim at optimizing, respectively,  the parameters of a GCN and its graph structure. This makes graph neural networks applicable to a much wider range of learning problems. We show that the proposed method outperforms related approaches by a significant margin on datasets where the dependency structure is either incomplete or completely missing. I'll also describe some applications of graph neural networks in the (bio-)medical domain.

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p>
Mathias Niepert is a chief research scientist of the Systems and Machine Learning (SysML) group at NEC Labs Heidelberg.
From 2012-2015 he was a postdoctoral research associate at the Allen School of Computer Science, University of Washington.
He was also a member of the Data and Web Science Research Group at the University of Mannheim and co-founded several open-source digital humanities projects such as the <a href="https://www.inphoproject.org/">Indiana Philosophy Ontology Project</a> and the <a href="http://lode.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/">Linked Humanities Project</a>.
