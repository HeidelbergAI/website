<h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>

<p>Our partner, the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), is hosting a school for MSc and PhD students as well as postdocs.
    <i>A Crash Course in Machine Learning with Applications in Natural- and Life Sciences (ML4Nature)</i> targets young researchers from Natural Sciences and Life Sciences who want to learn more about machine learning.
    As the organizers state, <i>a background in machine learning is not required. Besides introducing the basic concepts of machine learning, we teach selected topics in more depth, such as deep learning, metric learning, transfer learning, Bayesian inverse problems, and causality. Experts from machine learning, Natural Science and Life Science explain how these machine learning approaches are utilized to solve problems in their respective fields of research.</i>

<p>
    The event is co-organized by our program committee member Carsten Rother and includes lectures by our board member Klaus Maier-Hein and past heidelberg.ai speaker Bj√∂rn Ommer.
