<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>This is the first event of Heidelberg AI, with which we would like to get to know all people interested in participating. As we want to tailor the platform towards the wishes and ideas of all participants, there is going to be an open discussion about expectations and possible formats and topics.</p>

<p>We also hope to tickle you in just the right spots with 2 AI-related kick-off talks:</p>
