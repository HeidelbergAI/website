<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
    Although numerous AI-applications are already part of our daily life, the effective utilization of AI is quite new
    in the field of personalized medicine. Quite recently, different research projects show very promising results on
    how to help Medical Doctors automatize image analysis, patient diagnosis as well as to predict patient outcome.
    However, such algorithms are mostly used for research purposes the translation to a sustainable commercial product
    requires lots of different skill sets. In this presentation, Philipp Mann will outline how this was done and which
    hurdles have to be taken to successfully launch an AI-based analysis tool for the quantitative evaluation of brain
    MRI.
