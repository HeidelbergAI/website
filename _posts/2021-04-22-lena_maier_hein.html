<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>The breakthrough successes of deep learning-based solutions in various fields of research and practice have
    attracted a growing number of researchers to work in the field of medical image analysis. However,
    due to the increasing number of publicly available data sets, domain knowledge and/or close collaboration with
    domain experts is no longer an essential prerequisite.
    To demonstrate the potentially severe consequences of this recent development,
    this talk will highlight the importance of domain knowledge for various steps within the development process:
    from the selection of training/test data in the presence of possible confounders, to the choice of appropriate
    validation metrics and the interpretation of algorithm results.</p>

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p>Lena Maier-Hein received a Diploma (2005) and PhD degree (2009) with distinction from Karlsruhe
    Institute of Technology and conducted her postdoctoral at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and
    at the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery at Imperial College London. During her time as junior group leader
    at the DKFZ (2011-2016), she finished her Habilitation (2013) at the University of Heidelberg.
    As DKFZ division head she is now working in the field of biomedical image analysis with a specific focus on
    surgical data science, computational biophotonics and validation of machine learning algorithms.
    Lena Maier-Hein is fellow of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society
    and of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) and has been distinguished with
    several science awards including the 2013 Heinz Maier Leibnitz Award of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and
    the 2017/18 Berlin-Brandenburg Academy Prize. She has received a European Research Council (ERC) starting grant
    (2015-2020) and consolidator grant (2021-2026).
