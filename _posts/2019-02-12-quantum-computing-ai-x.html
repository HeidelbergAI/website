<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Recent advances in the realization of quantum computing devices have now brought us to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862">NISQ regime</a>.
We will discuss what kinds of algorithms may be possible within this regime and the pathways to a fault-tolerant quantum computer.
We will then provide an overview of the kinds of AI work we do at X.
</p>

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hidary">Jack Hidary</a> focuses on Quantum Computing and AI at Alphabet X (formerly Google X).</p>

<p>
Jack studied philosophy and neuroscience at Columbia University and was awarded a Stanley Fellowship in Clinical Neuroscience at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). Under the fellowship, he conducted research on the use of neural networks
to model and analyze the data in functional neuroimaging using techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET)
and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study brain states.
</p>

<p>
After doing research in neuroscience and AI at the NIH, Jack followed his fascination with technology and established EarthWeb, a company dedicated to the needs of tech professionals. Jack co-founded the company with his brother Murray Hidary and friend Nova Spivack. Jack led the company from its inception through three rounds of investment and then its IPO on NASDAQ. Under Jackâ€™s leadership, EarthWeb acquired Dice.com, a website that connects users with jobs, and other sites dedicated to the needs of IT professionals (NYSE: DHX)
As Chairman and CEO of the public company, Jack continued to grow the company and engage with shareholders, customers and analysts. After running the public company for more than three years, Jack handed off to a new CEO.
</p>

<p>
Jack became active in public service. He has been a board member of Trickle Up which helps thousands of entrepreneurs start small businesses each year. Jack established the <a href="https://hidaryfoundation.org/">Hidary Foundation</a> to focus on medical research.
Jack is also the co-founder and Chairman of Samba Energy, a technology company that integrates and implements clean tech solutions for enterprise customers.
</p>

<p>
Jack now is the Senior Advisor to X Labs, the advanced innovation lab of Alphabet/Google.
