<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Despite significant advances in technology and research, the Operating Room still remains one of the most secretive environments in modern society.
This presentation will highlight the impact of transparency and data-driven education & quality improvement on team performance and patient safety.
It will review best practices from other high-risk, high-performance industries, and highlight the cultural barriers and the opportunities for transfer of similar approaches in the peri-operative setting. The speaker will review the introduction of the OR Black Box platform and the use of Artificial Intelligence to analyze performance and surgical safety. Finally, the presenter will highlight the importance of changing safety culture in the Operating Room in order to transform surgery into a ultra-safe industry.
