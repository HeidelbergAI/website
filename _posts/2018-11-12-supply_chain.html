<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>


<a href="https://blueyonder.ai">Blue Yonder</a> stands for robust probabilistic machine learning and data driven decision optimization and automation, 
packaged into consumable scaling narrow-AI products for retailers running in the cloud, made in Germany and having 
developed from long and deep  experience in High Energy Physics. 
To fully profit from these products requires a massive change in the culture of decision making in companies. 
After the recent acquisition by jda the Blue Yonder technology will be distributed worldwide and widened both the 
complete supply chain up to the manufacturer and down to the end-customer. The underlying moonshot vision
is the autonomous supply chain, leading to a much improved efficiency, less waste and independent of human biases.
<br><br>
The talk will give an overview over the techniques applied, the history of the company, and some observations
on the applicability of AI in industrial settings. </p>
