<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
    Immersions is a system that lets us interact with and explore an audio processing neural network,
    or what Vincent calls an “artificial ear”. This network was trained in an unsupervised way on various music datasets
    using a contrastive predictive coding method. There are two modes of showing its inner workings - one is visual,
    the other is sonic. For the visualization, first, the neurons of the network are laid out in two-dimensional space,
    then their activation is shown at every moment, depending on the input, in real-time. To make audible how music sound
    to the artificial ear, an optimization procedure generates sounds that specifically activate certain neurons in the network.

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p>
     <a href="https://vincentherrmann.github.io/">Vincent Herrmann</a> caused quite a stir at last year's Neurips in Vancouver
    when demonstrating his Artificial Ear, which also earned him a well-deserved "Best Demonstration" award. His background is in classical music,
    but in the last years he has gotten more and more interested in the field of machine learning and artificial
    intelligence. At the moment he is finishing his Master thesis at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence.
    Right before that he got a Master’s degree in piano from the University of Music Stuttgart.
