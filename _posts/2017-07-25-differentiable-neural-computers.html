<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs) are a very recent new line of deep neural networks that are enhanced by a memory module. This allows them to read and write information for future use, which is considered a major step towards Artificial General Intelligence.</p>

<p>JÃ¶rg Franke (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) employs DNCs for his work in Natural Language Processing. He will introduce us to these exciting new models and share insights on their training and application.</p>

<h2 class="section-geading">Material</h2>

<p>Here's a collection of material if you'd like to familiarize yourself with the concept beforehand:
