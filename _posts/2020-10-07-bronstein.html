<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>
    Deep learning on graphs and network-structured data has recently become one of the hottest topics in machine
    learning. Graphs are powerful mathematical abstractions that can describe complex systems of relations and
    interactions in fields ranging from biology and high-energy physics to social science and economics. In this talk,
    Michael Bronstein will outline the basic methods, applications, challenges and possible future directions in the
    field.

<h2> Bio </h2>

<p>
    Michael Bronstein is a professor at Imperial College London, where he holds the Chair in Machine Learning and
    Pattern Recognition, and Head of Graph Learning Research at Twitter. Michael received his PhD from the Technion in
    2007. He has held visiting appointments at Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and Tel Aviv University, and has also been
    affiliated with three Institutes for Advanced Study (at TU Munich as a Rudolf Diesel Fellow (2017-2019), at Harvard
    as a Radcliffe fellow (2017-2018), and at Princeton (2020)). Michael is the recipient of five ERC grants, Member of
    Academia Europaea, Fellow of IEEE, BCS, IAPR, and ELLIS, ACM Distinguished Speaker, and World Economic Forum Young
    Scientist. In addition to his academic career, Michael is a serial entrepreneur and founder of multiple startup
    companies, including Novafora, Invision (acquired by Intel in 2012), Videocites, and Fabula AI (acquired by Twitter
    in 2019). He has previously served as Principal Engineer at Intel Perceptual Computing and was one of the key
    developers of the Intel RealSense technology.
